# Project Gitmem Design Principles

* Use dependency injection for inversion of control;
* Write for future extensibility;
* Write to interfaces: configure implementations;
* Modularize: loosely couple interface(s) with core functionality; Make it possible to drop in/configure other interfaces;
* Where feasible, favor immutable data;
* Text/copy intended for user consumption is configuration, and it should be extracted into configuration files;
